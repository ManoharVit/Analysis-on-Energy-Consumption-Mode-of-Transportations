# Analysis-on-Energy-Consumption-Mode-of-Transportations
Over time, one of the most significant aspects of life that has been put in danger by the current way of life of travel is the pollution that is being produced. They are damaging the environment, and in certain parts of the world, the pollution is turning certain cities inadequate
In this project we have analyzed the amount of energy consumption by various modes of transportation.  This is vary depending on the size of population, country. We have considered data related to the United States for this project
We chosen the dataset from the U.S. Census data and statistics from The Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) that offers categorical data on Energy Consumption by Mode of Transportation. 
By analyzing this data, we hope to determine whether we are considering the optimal modes of transportation
